# L2SP
This is the code to implement Low-dimensional Structure learning with Similarity Perserving (L2SP) framework. We proposed four experiments in this repository. Use runL2SPs to test sparse regularizer on classification problems; use runL2SPr to test low-rank on classification problems; use runL2SPssemi to test sparse regularizer on semiclassification problems and use runL2SPrsemi to test low-rank on semiclassification problems. We use YALE as a data sample to do experiments, feel free to try your own datasets.
